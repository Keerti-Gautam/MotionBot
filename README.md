# Motion Bot 

Motion Bot is a neatly written code which sends out a [webex teams](https://www.webex.com/products/teams/index.html) message upon sensing any motion. 

Motion Sensor uses Raspberry Pi interfaced with IR sensor to detect for any motion, and uses Webex API to eventually send a message to the authorised person.
